# Emojinator
Emojis are ideograms and smileys used in electronic messages and web pages. Emoji exist in various genres, including facial expressions, common objects, places and types of weather, and animals.  This project aims to localize your hand gestures and interpret them to an emoji representation. This technology can be further rendered for translating sign language. Since we are working with a live stream of data, we want to make sure that the predictions are made at runtime. For doing this efficiently, we use several filters to downsize the image that in turn, increases the efficiency. For building a predictive model, we use deep learning technique to train and develop a model which could do the needful consuming the minimum amount of CPU resources.
